# Brighton
Brighton is a real estate agency that has adopted technological innovations to improve its operations and services. As part of their strategy, Brighton employs iOS as a key platform to facilitate efficient communication between agents and clients. The accompanying application is designed to enhance the browsing experience for clients, allowing them to explore property listings and connect with agents seamlessly.

In this project, my role involved developing the application from scratch, with a particular focus on optimizing its performance to ensure smoother operation. This included refactoring and cleaning up the existing codebase to enhance readability and maintainability. By doing so, the code became easier to understand and document, which in turn improved collaboration and long-term maintenance of the application. Additionally, I played a key role in enhancing the application's user interface (UI) to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience. This involved implementing design refinements to improve usability and achieve a cleaner aesthetic, ultimately contributing to a better user experience (UX).

Moreover, I updated the technology used in the project, upgrading from Swift 4 to Swift 5. I also played a crucial role in creating UI tests to ensure the application functioned correctly before it was used by end-users. Additionally, I was instrumental in updating the technology from storyboard to XIB, utilizing a coordinator to manage view transitions. Furthermore, I managed the app store updates. By actively participating in these optimization efforts, I aimed to contribute to Brighton’s goal of leveraging technology to modernize its real estate services, providing a better and more seamless experience for both agents and clients.
