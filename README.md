# Cuci Cuci Shoes Care
Cuci Cuci Shoes Care is an application designed to assist in managing shoe cleaning service stores, located in Sedati, East Java, Sidoarjo. The app features branch office management, employee attendance, order processing with invoice printing, delivery tracking, and employee salary management.

Developed in collaboration with the Javasolit team, the project involved cooperation between Android developers using React Native and backend developers using the YII framework. My role in this project was as the project lead, serving as the liaison between the client and the team, conveying client requests and presenting ongoing progress. Additionally, I assisted in developing APIs necessary for the implementation of Android development.
